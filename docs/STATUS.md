# Status

Last updated: 2026-10-29. **This header names no branch and no sha, deliberately**: a line in the commit that moves the tip cannot name it. Read the current state from the repository, which cannot lag: `git log --oneline -1`. **`docs/QUEUE.md` is the work queue**, one item per session, taken from the top unless Alexah reorders.

## Works

One line per system; the detail, item by item, is `docs/WORKS.md` (grep it by area or Q-number, never read it whole).

- Lobby: the four islands, the front end, players and their saves, options, the advisor, weather, the island gate and the fly-in.
- The park's world: ground, paths, queues, placed and fixed objects, the boundary wall, sky, sea, weather, music, the calendar on the park's own clock, lighting, the camcorder.
- Building: the buy and hire screens, paths and queues laid by pointing, a ride carried over its squares and placed with its queue, a bought thing joining the running park with the original's next id, a kart or water ride's station and mouths and every track piece drawn, and its track laid run by run with the track tool, taken back a run at a time with Backspace, its circuit walked as the loop closes, each section with its collision objects and buoy, its open end pulsing red while the loop is open, each run shown by its squares before the click, lifted and walled as the original's, a run over a feature taking it down, an add-on's end caps shown and hidden by the put-down's walk (seen once in ours: the Tunnel's caps hid at the click), an add-on put down on its own ride's track by the original's snap, the hand turned to nought after it, the pieces' clips after a close and an add-on's put-down.
- Guests: eight kinds arrive, choose by the original's score, queue, ride, buy and pay; 23 of Lost Kingdom's 31 rides, shops and sideshows run for them (the website's ride list).
- Staff: all five kinds hired and working their kind's decide (cleaning, performing, researching), strikes, their voices.
- Rides: every placed thing runs its script, the rest of the opcodes counted; screams, particles, hoardings; the ride window closes and reopens its ride.
- Running the park: the gadget, the info and money screens, the entry price and the gate, the research lab and its screen, golden tickets, the advisor's messages.
- Saving: Save, Load, Restart Park, the quicksave keys; a Full Simulation park started empty, saved too (Q783: its file at tick nought, which the original loads).
- The original runs under Proton as the reference instrument.

## Does not

One line per system; the detail is `docs/DOES-NOT.md` (grep it by area or Q-number, never read it whole).

- Park and saving: no loan screen, litter or day's end; a written park holds no kart, water or tracked ride, and some voices, puffs and the music voice are not written (Q420, Q803); forty-four of the advisor's 155 polled messages are built.
- Map and windows: the map's overlay, hover and click are decoded, not built (Q684, Q685); five of the nine object windows are unbuilt (Q31b).
- Guests: the deciding turn's vomit, litter, fireworks and pranks and four queue turns are counted (Q224 to Q226, Q228); a failed route is not revived (Q104); queues lose more happiness than the original's (Q746).
- Building: a carried member of staff shows nothing; a bought thing's sparkles are not drawn (Q683); the buy screen's panel has no model (Q158).
- Lobby, keys and interface: the fly-in's fade (Q61) and F8 (Q65) are unbuilt; some keys and lists act differently from the original's (Q120, Q231, Q232); some meshes are drawn both-sided (Q613). No video or networking.
- Sound: a per-effect repeat delay that is really a priority (Q43); most of a park file's live voices are counted, not put back (Q741).
- Staff: the handyman's litter search and the guard's chase are unbuilt; a strike's posts are counted (Q212, Q229).
- Rides: the isles' random clips, the idle repeat, a coaster's excitement and the Hot Pot's wake are counted (Q76, Q77); a water ride's pieces flow only after an add-on's put-down (Q448).
- Camcorder: entered where the orbit looks, not by a click, and walks at 40 units a second where the original's measures about 21.8 (Q25); three of the four ride views are counted (Q246).

## Next

`docs/QUEUE.md`, from the top; its order, and who set it, is there. Every ticked item is in `docs/history/queue-done.md`.

## Not verified on screen

Only the item just landed is here. Every earlier item's account is in `docs/history/not-verified.md`, newest first, moved there by the maintainer's pre-commit hook: grep it by Q-number.

- Q801 (the rest of a park made fresh's file) and its review fixes. The original under Proton loaded r1's file (`q801/orig/l2`), not r2's,
  one comment apart. The script header count now matches the original's (file + records + made - gone: a load and save writes 28 over
  fourteen records, as an Instant Action save does), so a load and save here is no longer byte for byte the file; checked by test and by
  the original loading such a file (`q801fix/`). Not checked: a car's channel (karts, boats) through `WrittenChannel`, and a missing-clip
  start before any clip played, on a Lost Kingdom script. Q803 holds the leftovers (the weather's first week, the music voice, the other
  themes).




## Numbers (take counts fresh; these go stale within a day)

| | | measured |
|---|---|---|
| Opcodes | **78** of 106 | 2026-10-20, Q553 (`FADEOBJ`), `case Opcode.` labels vs enum members |
| Tests | **4285**, 0 fail, 2 skip with the game (the macOS and Windows tests of `UserFoldersTests`, run on Linux) | 2026-10-28, Q800 |
| Tests without the game | **1648** ran, **2637** skipped, of 4285 | 2026-10-28, Q800 |
| Build warnings | 115 after Q753, 132 before it (both `--no-incremental`, the 132 in a fresh worktree of `main`: the seven CA2022 short reads and the `Zio` advisory, repeated for each project that took it, gone); earlier: 121 in the main tree; 130 to 133 in a fresh worktree as NuGet's advisory list was last fetched, the ten or twelve more its advisories on ModKit's ImageSharp 3.1.6 (a sixth, GHSA-v76p-62qx-wwq2, published 2026-10-26: Q75, DECISIONS.md "Package advisories") | 2026-10-27 (the worktree's 133 at Q672's gate, 131 at fix group P's, run 11, and 130 at PERF PASS 1's; the main tree's 121 last counted 2026-10-13) |
| Park load | **2.5 s**, worst phase `terrain` 0.72 s | 2026-09-21, three jungle runs |
| Park load, Release | **3.1 to 3.4 s**, worst phase `audio` 1.04 s (`ground` 0.52 to 0.57, `terrain` 0.46 to 0.55, `objects` 0.35 to 0.47) | 2026-10-26, three runs, `perf/bench.sh` |
| Frame, stock jungle park, Release | **1.23 ms** a frame uncapped (about 810 fps, 18 guests) on the RX 6700 XT, the display's cap 143.9 fps held; **16.3 KB** allocated a frame (54.5 KB before the allocation pass), a gen 0 collection about every 1.3 s uncapped (every 0.37 s before), so about every 7 s at the display's 144 fps; worst frame about 24 ms; the CPU is the limit (89% of the frame on-CPU): 62% `Model.Draw` (NeoVeldrid's `FlushNewResourceSets` 23% of the frame), 11% `Level.Update`. The pass took the walk-head iterator, the boxed object enumerators, the furthest-first sort's copies, the picker's strings and `Unimplemented.Report`'s lock out of the frame and did not move the frame time (seven runs each: 1.230 ms, SD 0.005, before; 1.234 ms, SD 0.028, after); what is left to allocate is the shadow arrays and the bubble's closures (about 2.5 KB), `NodePoser.Pose`, the UI meshes, `ParkFlags.Grid` and the materials' resource sets | 2026-10-27, `perf/ab.sh` (`docs/TOOLING.md`) |

## Recent

Each finished item's account is its ticked entry in `docs/history/queue-done.md`; the dated accounts this section held
until 2026-10-28 are in `docs/history/status-recent.md`.
